---

<Steps>
  <Step title="Triaging" iconType="solid" stepNumber={1} titleSize="h3">
    Ravical connects to your mailbox and **evaluates every incoming email to determine if it's a customer interaction** or an internally forwarded message about a customer case. This filtering step helps the Agent focus only on conversations that need a response, ignoring newsletters, personal, or internal-only communications.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Gathering Context" iconType="solid" stepNumber={2} titleSize="h3">
    For every email that passes triage, the **Agent searches your connected tools** for relevant information. This might include:

    - Client **contact information** from your CRM
    - **Previous email threads** with this contact
    - **Client files** in relevant tools _(industry specific: eg. bookkeeping or post-accountancy tools for accountancy firms, Broker Management Systems for insurance brokers, etc)_
    - Relevant **knowledge databases** _(eg. an internal Sharepoint, and/or external knowledge sources specific to your industry)_

    **The Agent pulls together the context it needs, just like you would before crafting a response!**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Drafting a Response" iconType="solid" stepNumber={3} titleSize="h3">
    Using the context it gathered, the Agent generates a draft reply that addresses the client's question or request. The draft **matches your personal and firm's communication style** and includes the specific details needed (dates, amounts, next steps, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Your Review and Approval" iconType="solid" stepNumber={4} titleSize="h3">
    **The draft is never sent automatically.** You always have the opportunity to review and edit before anything goes out. You can:

    - Send the draft as-is
    - Make tweaks to tone or details
    - Add additional context the Agent might have missed
    - Provide feedback that helps the Agent improve future drafts

    This keeps you in control while eliminating the manual work of researching and writing routine responses from scratch.
  </Step>

  **The best part?**\
  \
  Steps 1-3 happen automatically within seconds of an email arriving in your mailbox. By the time you open your inbox, the draft is already waiting for you: ready to review and send. This means you **spend your time on decision-making, not on research and writing.**
