title: "Drafts: Tone of Voice "
description: "Ravical’s Inbox Agent is designed to sound just like you, so your clients feel like they’re always hearing from the same trusted person, not an AI system."

### Here’s how it works:

- **Personalized per client** – Whenever possible, the Agent reviews the last emails you’ve sent to a specific client and adapts its tone, phrasing, and style to match yours exactly. This means emails to your most formal clients maintain a professional tone, while messages to clients you know well keep their familiar, conversational warmth.
- **Smart fallback** – If there aren’t enough emails for that client, the Agent automatically uses other responses you’ve sent to anyone, ensuring it still captures your unique voice.

  The result? Seamless, consistent communication that keeps your client relationships personal.
