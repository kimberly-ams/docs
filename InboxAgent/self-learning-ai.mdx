description: "The Ravical Inbox Agent isn’t a static agent, it learns and improves based on the how you use it. Every interaction you have with the inbox Agent, helps it understanding your communication style, preference and needs better. Here’s how that process works. "

## Your Feedback Powers the Learning Process

The Agent learns through three main sources of information:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="1. The Instructions You Provide">
    When you write prompts in the Inbox Agent text field in Outlook, you're giving direct guidance on what you need. These instructions further shape how the Agent will respond in the future.

    **Example:** If you write "_Reply professionally but keep it brief_" or “_Use bullet points_” the Agent will not only use this to generate your draft email, but it will also remember the instructions for future similar emails.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="2. The Edits You Make">
    After the Agent creates a concept email, you might click to send it as-is, or you might make changes before sending. We compare the original concept email with the email you eventually send out. This comparison reveals what worked and what didn't. This not only trains the agent on a personal level for your inbox, but also trains the agent for your overall organization when relevant.

    **Example:**

    - Personal patterns: If the Agent writes "_I hope this email finds you well_" but you consistently change it to "_Thanks for reaching out,_" the system will learn your preferred opening style.
    - Organizational patterns: If everyone in your team always includes a specific disclaimer when discussing invoice adjustments, the Agent will learn to include this automatically, not just for you, but for your colleagues too.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="3. Your Thumbs Up/Down Feedback">
    You can rate the concept emails the Agent generates. This quick feedback tells us whether the draft was on track or missed the mark entirely, allowing us to periodically review and analyze why responses were good/poor. \
