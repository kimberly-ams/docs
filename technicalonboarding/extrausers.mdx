Need to grant additional team members access to your Ravical Agent(s)? This process requires a Microsoft administrator and involves three key steps: configuring security group permissions, activating the Outlook Add-in, and subscribing mailboxes. Follow this guide to ensure new users are properly set up and ready to use Ravical.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Users to Security Groups">
    Add the new users to the appropriate security groups based on the level of access they require:

    - **ravical-mail-read**, for read-only access
    - **ravical-mail-readwrite**, for read and write access

    For detailed instructions on adding members to security groups, see: [Adding Members to Security Groups](https://ravical.mintlify.app/technicalonboarding/securitygroups#adding-members-to-security-groups)

  <Step title="Activate the Outlook Add-in">
    Once users are added to the security groups, activate the Outlook Add-in for them by following Step 3 in our deployment guide: [Outlook Add-in Deployment Instructions](https://ravical.mintlify.app/technicalonboarding/outlook-addin#step-by-step-deployment-instructions)

    <Note>
      **Please note: **It can take **up to 72 hours** for the Add-in to appear for new users. This delay is a Microsoft platform limitation.
