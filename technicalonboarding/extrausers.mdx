## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Add Users to Security Groups

Add the new users to the appropriate security groups based on the level of access they require:

- **ravical-mail-read**, for read-only access
- **ravical-mail-readwrite**, for read and write access

For detailed instructions on adding members to security groups, see:

### Step 2: Activate the Outlook Add-in

Once users are added to the security groups, activate the Outlook Add-in for them by following Step 3 in our deployment guide:

<Note>
  **Please note:** It can take **up to 72 hours** for the Add-in to appear for new users. This delay is a Microsoft platform limitation.

### Step 3: Subscribe the new Mailboxes

If not already completed, contact your dedicated Ravical Customer Value Manager to subscribe the new users' mailboxes and complete the setup process.
