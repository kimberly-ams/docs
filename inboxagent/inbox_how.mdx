## 1. Triaging

Ravical connects to your mailbox and **evaluates every incoming email to determine if it's a customer interaction** or an internally forwarded message about a customer case. This filtering step helps the Agent focus only on conversations that need a response, ignoring newsletters, personal, or internal-only communications.

More details about our smart triaging system can be found here:

## 2. Gathering Context

For every email that passes triage, the **Agent searches your connected tools** for relevant information. This might include:

- Client **contact information** from your CRM
- **Previous email threads** with this contact
- **Client files** in relevant tools _(industry specific: eg. bookkeeping or post-accountancy tools for accountancy firms, Broker Management Systems for insurance brokers, etc)_
- Relevant **knowledge databases** _(eg. an internal Sharepoint, and/or external knowledge sources specific to your industry)_

**The Agent pulls together the context it needs, just like you would before crafting a response!**

## 3. Drafting a Response

Using the context it gathered, the Agent generates a draft reply that addresses the client's question or request. The draft **matches your personal and firm's communication style** and includes the specific details needed (dates, amounts, next steps, etc.).

## 4. Your Review and Approval

**The draft is never sent automatically.** You always have the opportunity to review and edit before anything goes out. You can:

- Send the draft as-is
- Make tweaks to tone or details
- Add additional context the Agent might have missed
- Provide feedback that helps the Agent improve future drafts

This keeps you in control while eliminating the manual work of researching and writing routine responses from scratch.

  **The best part?**\
  Steps 1-3 happen automatically within seconds of an email arriving in your mailbox. By the time you open your inbox, the draft is already waiting for you: ready to review and send. This means you **spend your time on decision-making, not on research and writing.**
