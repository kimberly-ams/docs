title: "Personalisation: Tone & Voice "
description: "Ravical’s Inbox Agent is designed to sound just like you, so your clients feel like they’re always hearing from the same trusted person, not an AI system."

### Here’s how it works:

- **Personalized per client** – Whenever possible, the Agent reviews the last emails you’ve sent to a specific client and adapts its tone, phrasing, and style to match yours exactly. This means emails to your most formal clients maintain a professional tone, while messages to clients you know well keep their familiar, conversational warmth.
- **Smart fallback** – If there aren’t enough emails for that client, the Agent automatically uses other responses you’ve sent to anyone, ensuring it still captures your unique voice.

  **The result?** Seamless, consistent communication that keeps your client relationships personal.
