<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Outlook & Pick an Email">
    Open your **Outlook inbox** and select any incoming email from a client. The Inbox Agent is designed to work directly inside Outlook, right where you already manage your correspondence.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch the Inbox Agent">
    Find the **Ravical icon** in the **Outlook menu**. Depending on your Outlook version, the Ravical icon might look slightly different from the image below.

    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pin the Inbox Agent">
    When you click the Ravical icon, the Inbox Agent opens as a **right-side panel**.

    <Tip>
      **Pro Tip:** Pin the sidebar so it stays open while you switch between emails. This allows you to move through your inbox efficiently without reopening the agent each time.
    </Tip>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Review & Refine the Draft">
    The Inbox Agent generates a **draft reply** based on:

    - The email thread context
    - Relevant data from your internal tools
    - Your personal tone of voice

    You can then:

    - **Edit** the draft directly
    - **Ask for changes** (e.g., "make it shorter", "write more formally")
    - **Add details** the agent may have missed

    <Tip>
      **Pro Tip:** Instruct the agent to personalize replies by providing custom guidance such as:

      - "Use a summary at the start"
      - "Add a conclusion in simple language"
      - "Use the standard office sign-off"
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use and Send">
    Happy with the result? Click **"Use this draft"** to insert the draft reply into your email window, then press send. The agent streamlines your response process while keeping you in full control of the final message.
