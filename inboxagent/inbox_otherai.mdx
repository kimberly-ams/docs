## Why the Inbox Agent Is Purpose-Built for Your Work

You've likely used ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, or other AI assistants. They're impressive tools, but they weren't designed for the specific challenges of client communication in advisory and professional services.

The Inbox Agent is purpose-built for professionals in your industry. Here are four major categories how it differs from general AI tools:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Access to Your Internal Knowledge">
    **General AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot):** Have broad knowledge about accounting, legal, and business topics, but no access to your specific client files, internal documents, or proprietary systems. You'd need to manually copy and paste information, which is time-consuming and risky.

    **Inbox Agent:** Directly integrates with your CRM, document management systems, accounting software, and knowledge bases specific to your country and industry.

    **What this means for you:** The agent answers based on _your_ data and _your_ client's specific situation, not just general knowledge.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Optimized for Advisory Firms">
    **General AI tools:** Use a single AI model that's designed for general purposes. There's no specific evaluation of whether answers are relevant for your industry.

    **Inbox Agent:** Uses the most optimal AI model for advisory firms specifically. We evaluate answer accuracy and relevance for your industry, ensuring responses meet the standards clients expect from professional advisors.

    **What this means for you:** Responses are contextually appropriate for communication to your specific customer base.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Learns Your Personal Writing Style">
    **General AI tools:** Write correctly and professionally, but in a generic voice. Responses sound like it came from "an AI" rather than from you.

    **Inbox Agent:** Learns from your previous communication to match your unique writing style.

    **What this means for you:** Clients feel like they're hearing from the same trusted person they always work with, not a generic AI assistant.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="4. Built for Data Security and Compliance">
    **General AI tools:** Require you to copy and paste sensitive client information into a third-party platform. This creates data leak risks and potential compliance issues.

    **Inbox Agent:** Security and compliance are foundational, not afterthoughts:

    - **ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certified**
    - **Fully GDPR-compliant**
    - **Your data stays under your control:** no copying sensitive information to external platforms
    - Direct, secure connections to your existing systems

    **What this means for you:** You can use AI assistance without compromising client confidentiality or regulatory compliance.
  </Accordion>

## The Bottom Line

General AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are excellent for many tasks: brainstorming, general writing, learning new topics. But when it comes to responding to client inquiries with accurate, personalized answers based on your internal data, they fall short.

The Inbox Agent was built specifically for this challenge. It combines AI capabilities with direct access to your systems, continuous optimization for your industry, personalized writing, and enterprise-grade security.
