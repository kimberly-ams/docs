### Your Feedback Powers the Learning Process

The Agent learns through three main sources of information:

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

All your feedback feeds into what we call **evaluators**. Think of evaluators as quality checkers that assess the Agent's performance. These evaluators help us understand not just what happened, but why certain drafts worked better than others.

We use evaluator insights to test new models specifically for your industry and use case. Before any changes are made to your Agent, we ensure the updates will actually improve performance for the types of emails you handle most.

### What This Means for You

Your interactions are not just one-off requests, they're training data that makes the Agent more valuable over time. The more you use it and the more feedback you provide (whether through edits or thumbs up/down), the better it becomes at supporting your specific workflow.
