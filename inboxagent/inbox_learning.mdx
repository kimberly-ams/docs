description: "The Ravical Inbox Agent isn’t a static agent, it learns and improves based on the how you use it. Every interaction you have with the inbox Agent, helps it understanding your communication style, preference and needs better. Here’s how that process works. "

### Your Feedback Powers the Learning Process

The Agent learns through three main sources of information:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Instructions You Provide">
    When you write prompts in the Inbox Agent text field in Outlook, you're giving direct guidance on what you need. These instructions further shape how the Agent will respond in the future.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edits You Make">
    After the Agent creates a concept email, you might click to send it as-is, or you might make changes before sending. We compare the original concept email with the email you eventually send out. This comparison reveals what worked and what didn't. This not only trains the agent on a personal level for your inbox, but also trains the agent for your overall organization when relevant.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Thums Up/Down Feedback">
    You can rate the concept emails the Agent generates. This quick feedback tells us whether the draft was on track or missed the mark entirely, allowing us to periodically review and analyze why responses were good/poor. \
    \
    Negative? Make sure to let us know what exactly went wrong by selecting one or more of the available categories.

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

All your feedback feeds into what we call **evaluators**. Think of evaluators as quality checkers that assess the Agent's performance. These evaluators help us understand not just what happened, but why certain drafts worked better than others.

We use evaluator insights to test new models specifically for your industry and use case. Before any changes are made to your Agent, we ensure the updates will actually improve performance for the types of emails you handle most.

### What This Means for You

Your interactions are not just one-off requests, they're training data that makes the Agent more valuable over time. The more you use it and the more feedback you provide (whether through edits or thumbs up/down), the better it becomes at supporting your specific workflow.
