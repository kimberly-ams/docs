title: "What It Does and Why It Helps"
description: "Imagine having an assistant who prepares email responses to incoming customer emails. That's exactly what the Ravical Inbox Agent does: it helps you respond to client emails faster and more consistently. Instead of starting from scratch, you get a ready-to-review draft. Simply review, tweak if needed, and send."

### What It Does

The Inbox Agent handles the time-consuming preparation work for every client email:

- **Gathers the information you need.** The agent automatically searches your internal systems (eg. accounting software, document libraries, CRM tools, and other connected platforms) to find relevant information for each inquiry.
- **Drafts contextual responses.** Using the information it finds, the agent writes a complete draft reply tailored to the specific question and context.
- **Matches your writing style.** The agent learns how you communicate and adapts its drafts to match your tone, phrasing, and company style guidelines. Responses sound like they came from you, not a generic AI.
- **Stays ready in your inbox.** The agent works directly within your email environment, so there's no separate platform to check or extra steps in your workflow.

### Why It Helps

- **Eliminates friction in your day.** No more "let me check and get back to you" delays. The agent does the legwork of finding information and structuring a response before you even open the email.
- **Ensures nothing gets missed.** The agent checks relevant sources systematically, reducing the risk of overlooked details. Clients get complete, accurate answers.
- **Reclaims your time for high-value work.** Instead of researching information across tools and drafting responses, you simply review and send.

### You Stay in Control

The Inbox Agent drafts responses, but you remain the decision-maker. Every draft comes to you for review before sending. You can:

- Accept the draft as-is if it's perfect
- Make quick edits to personalize or adjust details
- Completely rewrite if the situation requires a different approach
- Provide feedback that helps the agent improve future drafts

<Tip>
  The agent makes your work lighter by handling the preparation, but you keep full control over what your clients receive.
