> **Our Inbox Agent helps you respond to client emails. It can automatically draft replies, look up the necessary information from your systems, and adapt to your personal writing style. The benefit? You no longer need to spend several minutes crafting each email. You simply review the draft, tweak a detail if needed, and send it off.**
