### Understanding How the Agent Builds Responses

Transparency in AI Agents isn't just nice to have. It saves you time by linking directly to relevant documents, helps you spot errors quickly by showing the agent's logic, and builds confidence so you can send responses knowing they're well-grounded. You get full visibility into the agent's work, making you a more effective reviewer rather than a blind approver.

### How the Agent Uses Sources

During implementation, we connect the Inbox Agent to your relevant tools. The agent builds its responses by searching these connected sources for information relevant to each inquiry.

<Tip>
  **Example:** When a client asks about open invoices, the agent might search your accounting software for the status before drafting a response.
</Tip>

### Viewing Connected Sources

To see which sources are available to the agent:

1. Open the Inbox Agent
2. Click the **Sources** button at the bottom of the draft
3. Review the list of connected systems and tools

This gives you an overview of what information the agent can access when preparing responses.

### Seeing Sources Used Per Draft

Underneath each draft response, you'll find specific sources the agent used to compose that particular email. This isn't just a list of tools: it shows you the exact files, documents, records, or entries the agent referenced.

**These source links are clickable.** Click any source to jump directly to that information in its original system. No need to manually search - the agent has already found it for you.

<Tip>
  **Example:** If the agent referenced "Policy_document.pdf" from SharePoint, you can click that link to open the actual document and verify the information yourself.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

Beyond showing sources, the agent explains its reasoning process. You can see:

- What information it found in each source
- How it interpreted the client's question
- What connections it made between different pieces of information
- The Agent’s analysis of your tone of voice and how this was applied

### You Control the Final Response

The Inbox Agent does the groundwork: gathering information and preparing a draft. Based on the information it finds it aims to be as compliant as possible. However, you should still review each draft to ensure it fully meets your compliance requirements before sending.

The agent supports your compliance review by:

- Listing all sources used in the draft
- Providing direct links to verify information
- Showing its reasoning so you can check its interpretation
