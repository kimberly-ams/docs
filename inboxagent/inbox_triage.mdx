description: "Not every email that lands in your inbox requires a response. The Ravical Inbox Agent uses intelligent triaging to distinguish between emails that need your attention and those that don't. This ensures you only see draft replies when they actually add value, helping you focus on what matters most."

### What is Triaging?

When emails arrive in your Outlook inbox, Ravical's Inbox Agent doesn't automatically generate draft replies for every single one. Instead, it uses an intelligent triaging system to determine which emails actually need a response from you and which ones don't.

Think of it as your agent asking itself: "Does this email require action, or is this something the user can handle with a quick read or ignore?"

### How does Triaging work?

The triaging system analyzes multiple signals to make smart decisions about each incoming email:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Email Content Analysis" icon="newspaper">
    The agent reads and understands what the email is actually about. Newsletters, automated notifications, and promotional content typically don't need responses. But a question from a colleague, a customer inquiry, or a request for information clearly does.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sender Information" icon="person-dress-simple" iconType="regular">
    Who sent the email matters. The agent considers whether this is someone you regularly correspond with, someone new reaching out, or an automated system sending you updates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Email Addresses and Recipients" icon="mailbox">
    The agent looks at whether you're the primary recipient, CC'd, or part of a larger group. An email where you're one of 50 people CC'd is handled differently than one sent directly to you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Context Signals" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Elements like thread history, subject lines, and email metadata all feed into the decision. If you've been going back and forth with someone, that's different from a cold outreach.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Why does this matter?

Without triaging, you'd end up with draft replies for every promotional email, newsletter, and system notification that hits your inbox. That's not helpful, it's noise.

The triaging system ensures you only see draft replies when they actually add value. This means less clutter and more focus on the emails that genuinely need your attention.

### Manually generating a draft

Sometimes you may disagree with the triaging decision. Simply click the **"Generate draft reply"** button to manually create a draft. The agent will generate a new reply, which could take up to 10 seconds to load. Once complete, it functions just like any other draft reply in your Outlook inbox.
