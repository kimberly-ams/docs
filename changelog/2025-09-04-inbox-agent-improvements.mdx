  # How we improved the Inbox Agent over the summer

  ### **Smarter drafts. Clearer sources. Deeper context.**

  We’ve been working closely with our customers to push the Inbox Agent forward in meaningful ways. This release focuses on three key areas: making the agent’s reasoning more transparent, aligning responses more closely with your firm’s voice and formatting, and deepening its connection to the tools you already use.

  ### **More Transparent. More Personal. More Aligned.**

  One of the most common requests we heard was: _“I want to understand why the agent said that.”_ So we made it easier to trace its reasoning. Sources are now clearly listed in the UI. You see not just what the agent wrote, but where it came from.

  We also rebuilt how personalisation works. The agent now adapts better to individual writing styles and firm-specific formatting. Sign-offs, opening lines and signature blocks now follow your standards automatically, making drafts feel less GPT-like and more like something _you_ would write.

  ### **A Smarter Agent Under the Hood**

  We’ve upgraded the agent’s reasoning engine with a **new underlying model** and optimised prompts. It now handles nuance better, asks fewer follow-up questions, and makes smarter assumptions when context is missing.

  We also improved how the agent pulls in relevant information. Lookups are faster and more accurate, including more customer details, prior emails, and other useful information, so replies feel more grounded in your context.

  The agent can now read and cite attachments directly in drafts, includes a built-in calculator and has better triage logic to identify what actually needs your attention.

  The agent now integrates with Belgium’s **KBO company register**, letting it pull in relevant company details on demand. With **Microsoft Calendar** access, it can suggest meeting times based on your (and your colleagues’) actual availability, cutting down on scheduling back-and-forth.

  These connections help the agent operate in your real-world business context, not just what’s in the inbox.

  ### **A UI That Supports You (Without Getting in the Way)**

  The Outlook add-in is now easier to keep pinned, with helpful nudges built in. A new “Improve this answer” prompt makes it easier to refine drafts. You can browse through past versions when you want to go back. And yes, dark mode is now supported.

  We also polished the overall experience. Drafts now respect your Outlook defaults for font and colour. And we’ve improved wording throughout the interface to make features more understandable and easier to use.
