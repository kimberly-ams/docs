<Accordion title="How does Ravical’s Inbox Agent generate a response to my emails?">
  Think of Ravical’s Inbox Agent as your newly hired assistant. Like a new hire from a big 4 consultancy, it arrives with a **backpack of experience:** industry knowledge and a solid understanding of how to communicate professionally.

  But just like any real-life hire, to answer **your clients’** questions correctly, the Agent needs access to **your** firm’s information:

  - Client files in your CRM
  - Internal knowledge bases
  - Other tools you use to store and manage information

  The more systems we connect, the more the Agent can search for the exact details it needs - just like you would look up a client file before replying.

  And just like a new hire, the Agent will get better with training. The first few times, you might need to make small corrections. Over time, as you give more guidance, the Agent will adapt to your preferences and start producing responses that sound exactly like you want, without you needing to step in.

  In short: Ravical’s Inbox Agent acts like a proactive, well-trained assistant: pulling the right context from your systems and getting better the more you work together.

<Accordion title="I don’t want the customer to notice that the response was written by AI.">
  Ravical’s Inbox Agent is designed to sound just like you, so your clients feel like they’re always hearing from the same trusted person, not an AI system.

  Here’s how it works:

  - **Personalized per client** – Whenever possible, the Agent reviews the last 5 emails you’ve sent to a specific client and adapts its tone, phrasing, and style to match yours exactly.
  - **Smart fallback** – If there aren’t enough emails for that client, the Agent automatically uses other responses you’ve sent to anyone, ensuring it still captures your unique voice.

  The result? Seamless, consistent communication that keeps your client relationships personal.

<Accordion title="What makes Ravical different from ChatGPT / Co-Pilot?">
  While tools like ChatGPT or Co-Pilot can generate generic answers, Ravical is designed specifically for your firm and your industry.

  Here’s how we’re different:

  1. **Connected to your systems** – Ravical integrates with your CRM, knowledge base, and other internal tools, so it can pull the exact client and policy details you need, without you having to paste them in manually.
  2. **Understands your style** – Ravical learns from your past email communication and mirrors your tone, so replies feel consistent and personal.
  3. **Tailored to your workflows** – Our Inbox Agent searches the same places you would, applies your firm’s context, and delivers answers that are not just correct, but relevant to your clients.
  4. **Built with enterprise-grade security and compliance -** Copy‑pasting sensitive customer details into an open AI chat can be risky. Ravical, on the other hand, is designed to safeguard your data. We hold ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification and fully comply with GDPR, ensuring your client information stays secure and within your control.

<Accordion title="Where does Ravical’s Inbox Agent get its information from?">
  Ravical’s Inbox Agent gathers relevant information from the tools and data sources your organization uses - just like you would when preparing a reply yourself! This can include your CRM, knowledge base, shared drives, and other connected systems.

  You can see exactly how the Agent built its response by checking the **“Reasoning”** section at the bottom of the side panel, underneath the draft we generated.

  If you notice that something is missing or could be improved, simply give the Agent **feedback** directly in Ravical. Your instructions will generate an updated response, and teach the Agent to do better next time.
