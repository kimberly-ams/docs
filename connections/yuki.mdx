### Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Yuki API key">
    Through Yuki Web services, you can create an access code (API key) that allows external software applications like Ravical to access your Yuki data.

    Follow the instructions in this Yuki article to create your API key:\

    <Warning>
      **Important:** Only a Yuki user with the Portal administrator role can create an API key. This key will only provide access to domains and administrations that the portal administrator has access to.
    </Warning>

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Blocklisting Specific Administrations

Do you have administrations in your Yuki environment that should not be accessible to the Agent? We can blocklist specific administrations to prevent the agent from accessing or sharing their details.

  alt="Yuki Blocklist"
  title="Yuki Blocklist"
  style={{ width:"57%" }}
/>

To set up a blocklist, share the administration IDs with your Customer Value Manager. Ravical will configure the blocklist for you.

**How to find administration IDs:**

1. Navigate to 'Settings' in Yuki.
2. Select 'Administrations'.
3. Open each administration you want to blocklist.
4. Copy the ID from the URL of the opened page.
5. Repeat this process for every administration you want to blocklist.

### Connection not working?

Check if:

- You copied the correct API key (without extra spaces at the start or end)
- You're logged in as a Portal administrator in Yuki
- You have access to the administration you want to connect
