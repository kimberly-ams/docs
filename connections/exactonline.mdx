## Scoped Access (Optional)

### What Is Scoped Access?

By default, when you connect Exact Online, the administrator's credentials are used to access data across your entire Exact Online tenant. **Scoped access** provides more granular control by allowing each individual Ravical user to authenticate separately with their own Exact Online credentials.

This means:

- Each user only accesses the Exact Online data they have permission to see
- The Inbox Agent respects the same data permissions that exist in Exact Online
- Better security and compliance with least-privilege access principles

### How to Set Up Scoped Access

Scoped access requires a three-step process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Administrator Connects Exact Online">
    First, an administrator must connect Exact Online through the Ravical Dashboard using the standard connection steps above. This establishes the initial connection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Scoped Access Support">
    Contact your **Ravical Customer Value Manager** to enable scoped access for your organization. This is a one-time configuration change on Ravical's side.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Individual User Authentication">
    Once scoped access is enabled, each Ravical user will be prompted to authenticate with their own Exact Online credentials the first time they use the Inbox Agent. This ensures they only access data they're authorized to see.
