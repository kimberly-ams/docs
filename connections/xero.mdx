## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Connections">
    1. Log in to your Ravical Dashboard
    2. Click on **Connections** in the left sidebar
    3. Locate the **Xero** tile in the integrations list
    4. Click **Connect** to begin the setup process

    <img
      src="/images/Xero1.png"
      alt="Xero1 Pn"
      title="Xero1 Pn"
      style={{ width:"78%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate with Xero">
    You will be forwarded to Xero where you need to authenticate using **administrator credentials**. Next, Ravical will request permission to Xero access to retrieve relevant information from the Xero environment when necessary.

    - Select the correct Organisation(s). In this example we are connecting access for the "Trial1" organisation.

    <img
      src="/images/Xero3.png"
      alt="Xero3 Pn"
      title="Xero3 Pn"
      style={{ width:"56%" }}
    />

    Click **"Allow Access"** and your Xero instance will now be connected.
