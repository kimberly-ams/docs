## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Create Adsolut Integration

In this step we will create a new Adsolut integration. You can do this step yourself or request help from either Ravical or your Adsolut support contact.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login to Adsolut">
    Go to https://my.adsolut.com and authenticate with your administration login credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Integrations">
    Go to **Settings** and click the **Integration** tile.

      style={{ width:"84%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up a New Application for Ravical">
    Click **New application** on the **Adsolut API Connectivity** tile. Enter a name for the application (We will use `Ravical-demo` ) in this manual. The adsolut integration is now created but still needs to be configured.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Configure Adsolut Integration

Start by clicking **<u>Configure integration</u>** on your application’s tile. Next we will:

1. Select the administrations which this integration can access.
2. Select the administrator (only one) whose credentials will be requested and used for all requests for this integration.
3. Fill in the technical details and store the client configuration in a safe place.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Administrations">
    Click **'+ Select administrations'** and select the administrations that should be available to Ravical. Confirm by clicking the blue confirmation button in the bottom corner.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Technical Details">
    Lastly, create a new secret by clicking the **"Generate new Secret"** button in the Technical Details tab.

    <Tip>
      Store the **client id** and **client secret** somewhere safe. You’ll need these in a later step.
    </Tip>
    Enter the following redirect URI: `https://dashboard.prod.ravical.com/integrations/oauth`

    Enter the following post logout URI:

    `https://dashboard.prod.ravical.com`

    Click **Select Scopes** and select the following scopes:

    - WK.BE.Accounting
    - WK.BE.Accounting.Read

    ![Adsolut Scope](/AdsolutScopes)

    Click the `Save` button. The integration should now be succesfully configured to be added to your Ravical account.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 3. Connect to Ravical

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Connections">
    1. Log in to your Ravical Dashboard
    2. Click on **Connections** in the left sidebar
    3. Locate the **Adsolut** tile in the integrations list
    4. Click **Connect** to begin the setup process

    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initialize Adsolut">
    Fill in the **client id** and **client secret** your stored previously. Click **Initialize Adsolut**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate Adsolut">
    Now we must still authenticate the connection. Click the **Authenticate** button on the enabled Adsolut connection card. You’ll be redirected to the Adsolut login page and you’ll be asked for your consent.

    <Warning>
      You must login with **the same user** that was selected as the administrator user for the Adsolut integration.
    </Warning>
    <img
      src="/AdsolutAuthenticate"
      alt="Adsolut Authenticat"
      title="Adsolut Authenticat"
      style={{ width:"47%" }}
    />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve Connection">
    Adsolut will show a list of permissions that you need to approve in order for the connection to be made.

    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-11-19at16.01.47.png"
      alt="Screenshot2025 11 19at16 01 47 Pn"
      title="Screenshot2025 11 19at16 01 47 Pn"
      style={{ width:"77%" }}
    />

    When you click **'Yes, approve'** you will be redirected back to the Ravical Connections page and the Adsolut connection should no longer prompt you to authenticate.
