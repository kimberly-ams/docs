### Step-by-Step Guide

    <Tip>
      **TIP:** When creating your API user,

      - Give it a recognizable name (e.g., "Ravical")
      - Save the generated API key, you'll need it for the connection in Ravical
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant Read Access to Required Modules">
    In the AdminConsult API configuration, enable **read access** (left column) for the following modules:

    1. Permanent Dossier
    2. Financial
    3. Taskflow
    4. DMS
    5. Registraties
    6. HRM

    <Tip>
      **Important:** Only read access is required. Write access (right column) should remain disabled.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Note Your Connection Details">
    You'll need two pieces of information:

    - **API Key:** The unique key generated when you created the API user
    - **Base URL:** Your API endpoint address (see the [AdminConsult documentation](https://syneton.zendesk.com/hc/nl/articles/360015107099-API-activatie-en-configuratie#h_01EEA50ZVEP1MVTGHHH76DE51H) for how to find this)
