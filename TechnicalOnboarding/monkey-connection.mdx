  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Authentication Type">
    A connection modal will appear with two authentication options. Select the method that matches your organization's setup:

    **Option A: Standard Authentication**

    - Use this if you log in to monKEY with a regular username and password
    - Best for organizations not using Microsoft Single Sign-On

    **Option B: Microsoft SSO**

    - Use this if your organization uses Microsoft for authentication
    - Best for organizations with Microsoft 365 integration

    Select your preferred authentication type from the dropdown menu.

  <Step title="Enter Your Credentials">
    **For Standard Authentication:**

    1. Enter your monKEY email address in the email field
    2. Enter your monKEY password in the password field

    **For Microsoft SSO:**

    1. Enter your Microsoft account email address
    2. Enter your Microsoft account password
    3. You may be redirected to Microsoft's login page to complete authentication
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Two-Factor Authentication (Optional but Recommended)">
    If your monKEY account uses two-factor authentication (2FA), you'll need to provide your TOTP secret:

    1. Click on **Add Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP)** to expand the section
    2. In the field that appears, enter the TOTP secret from your authenticator app

    **Tips for finding your TOTP secret:**

    - Look for "Secret Key" or "Manual Entry" in your authenticator app
    - The secret is usually a long string of letters and numbers
    - This is optional - leave empty if you're not using 2FA

    To hide this section, click **Hide Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP)**.

  <Step title="Complete the Connection">
    1. Review all the information you've entered
    2. Click **Connect** to establish the connection
    3. If successful, the monKEY tile will update to show a connected status

    If the connection fails, double-check your credentials and try again. You can click **Cancel** at any time to close the modal without connecting.
