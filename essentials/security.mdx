title: "How Ravical Keeps Your Data Secure"
description: "At Ravical, we build AI agents that help advisors at expert firms deliver faster, more consistent and high-quality client interactions. But innovation only works if it’s built on trust. That’s why we’ve made data protection, privacy and security our foundation, not a layer added later. Everything we build is designed to meet the expectations of regulated industries and privacy-conscious firms."

### **Built for trust from day one**

Ravical is designed with enterprise-grade security and privacy-first architecture. We are**ISO 27001 certified**  and fully **GDPR compliant**. Our infrastructure, policies and operations are built to meet evolving standards - including the [EU AI Act](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence) . We maintain robust internal controls and model governance processes to ensure responsible AI development and regulatory readiness.

You can follow our progress and access technical documentation in our [Trust Center](https://trust.ravical.com/), where we maintain transparency around certifications, subprocessors and updates. 

### **How we protect personal and sensitive data** 

We process personal data only when necessary to deliver and support the intended functionality of our AI agents. This processing is limited to what’s essential and is always done within clearly defined boundaries. 

- Data is accessed only when operationally required, and never more than necessary 
- We do not retain personal data longer than strictly necessary, nor reuse it across environments or customers 
- Personal data is never used to train shared or general-purpose models 
- Exposure of identifiable information is minimised by design, with safeguards in place to ensure it remains protected throughout its lifecycle 

Our approach ensures that personal data is handled with care, used responsibly, and never repurposed beyond its original intent. 

### **How our models learn - without compromising privacy** 

Ravical agents are built on domain-trained models, already familiar with the language and knowledge of your industry. Once deployed inside your organisation, the model adapts based on how your users interact with it. 

- The agent gets smarter by observing what users accept, reject or modify - not by copying message content 
- Feedback stays within your environment 
- No firm’s data is ever used to improve another firm’s agent 
- If any deeper training were ever proposed, it would only happen with explicit approval, and the model would remain exclusive to your firm.  

This approach ensures that learning stays local, privacy is preserved, and no competitive data leakage occurs.

### **Access control: privacy within your own organisation** 

We recognise that not all data should be accessible across teams. That’s why Ravical enforces strict access boundaries within each organisation. 

- Each agent is scoped to a specific team, user group, or environment. Agents can only access emails from the mailbox they’re assigned to - they cannot view or process messages from other teams or colleagues.
- This intra-organisational ringfencing is a core architectural principle, not a configurable option. Client-based memory may only be enabled explicitly and with strict confidentiality safeguards. 

### **Security at the organisational level** 

Our approach to security is holistic, covering infrastructure, people, and processes. We follow best practices that meet and exceed enterprise standards: 

- ISO 27001 certification across our systems and team operations
- Data segregation: every firm’s data is logically and technically isolated 
- Controlled access to systems via secure authentication, audit logging, and least-privilege principles 
- Secure development lifecycle, including code review, vulnerability testing and third-party audits 

Access to any customer data - whether for diagnostics or support - follows our ISO 27001-controlled process and is always logged and reviewed.
